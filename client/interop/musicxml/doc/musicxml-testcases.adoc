= MusicXML Testcases

* MusicXML can be exported / generated by most third party software.

* The current software used to generate MusicXML files in Alda is MuseScore.

* To add a MusicXML example / testcase to Alda, use the following steps:

** Open MuseScore and edit your score.

** Screenshot your score, and save as a png.

** Export your score to uncompressed MusicXML (extension `.musicxml`).

*** In MuseScore, do this by going to File > Export > MusicXML > Uncompressed.

** Save both the `.png` and `.musicxml` files with the same name to the
`examples` folder.

** [Optional] Write a test case for import in `import_test.go`.
