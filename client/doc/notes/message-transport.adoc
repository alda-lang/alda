= Message transport

== Overview

* The Alda client sends bundles of OSC messages over UDP to the Alda player.

* It's possible to send OSC over TCP as well, but UDP is the typical choice for
  OSC communication.
** The trade-off is that UDP offers better latency, at the expense of
reliability.

* OSC messages can be sent as bundles, which have the benefit that you either
  get all of the messages or none of them.

* Re: Alda, we would prefer to lose an entire score over losing parts of it. So,
  we send the entire score as a single bundle.
** There are other ways that we could get the same benefit if we had to send
   multiple packets. So, it isn't essential that the score actually be a single
   OSC bundle. We just need a way of representing the messages of a score as a
   single unit.
** Even if we did send a score in multiple bundles, the concept of the "bundle"
   ("transaction" is really a better name) is important because the player needs
   the full context of the score / score update before it schedules the notes.
*** For example, after scheduling the notes, the player bumps its internal
    notion of what the next scheduling offset will be, based on the latest
    notes.

== UDP packet size limits

NOTE: https://forum.juce.com/t/osc-blobs-are-lost-above-certain-size/20241/2

* The UDP protocol allows a limit of 64K, but the practical guaranteed limit
  is 576 bytes.

* The person posting about this in the link above recommended a limit of 512
  bytes to be safe.

== Implications

* A score of sufficient size will completely fail to play.

* Testing this with Alda:
** The Bach cello suite example played successfully.
** The `variables.alda` example did NOT play successfully as written.
*** Changing `rockinRiff*8` to `rockinRiff*6` worked. So I'm hitting the size
limit somewhere beyond 6 repetitions.

== Exploration

* By running `bundle.MarshalBinary()` on the bundle to get the byte array and
  printing its length, I was able to get an idea of how the number of Alda
  events translates into the size of the bundle in bytes.
** hello_world.alda => 9 events, 544 bytes
** bach_cello_suite_no_1.alda => 658 events, 34K bytes
** variables.alda w/ `rockinRiff*6` => 1152 events, 60K bytes
** variables.alda w/ `rockinRiff*8` => 1536 events, 80K bytes
** I was similarly able to see the size of the individual messages, and it
appears to consistently be 48 bytes for note messages. Other types of messages
are smaller, which makes sense because the note messages have more arguments.

* We would clearly need to send a fair amount of packets if we want to be sure
  that the packets' sizes are all 512 bytes or less.
** In the case of variables.alda w/ `rockinRiff*8`, it would take about 150
packets.
** From what I've read about UDP and packet loss, it should be rare that we lose
any packets when we're sending such a small number of them, especially just on
the loopback interface (between two processes on a single machine).

* Given that the individual OSC messages are at most 48 bytes...
** 512 / 48 = 10.666...
** So 8 messages is probably a good size. 48 * 8 = 384 bytes, well under 512.

== Solution

* Send scores in bundles of 512 bytes or less, guaranteeing that packets
  won't be dropped because they're larger than the particular limit on someone's
  machine.

* Add a `/transaction/ID_HERE` route to the Alda OSC API.
** Bundles can start with a `/transaction/ID_HERE` message to specify the
sequence number and total number of messages in a transaction.

* The player will collect messages in a transaction and hold off on taking
  action until it has received all of the packets.
