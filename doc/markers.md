# Markers**Markers** can be placed and referenced at any point during a score, and in any instrument part. e.g. `%chorus` will place a marker called "chorus" at the current offset, and then using `@chorus` at any point will set the current [offset](offset.md) to that of the "chorus" marker.A marker cannot be referenced before it is placed -- for example, the following score will result in an error:```piano:  @someMarkerThatDoesntExistYet  c8 d e f g2guitar:  r1  %someMarkerThatDoesntExistYet```Instead, the placement of the marker must occur before the marker is referenced:```guitar:  r1  %someMarkerThatDoesntExistYetpiano:  @someMarkerThatDoesntExistYet  c8 d e f g2```## Acceptable Marker NamesMarker names follow the same rules as [instrument names](scores-and-parts.md#acceptable-names).
