  ; Ideally, we would be able to dynamically test all .alda files in the
  ; examples/ resource directory, but Clojure resources are all thrown into a
  ; bucket and referenced by filename, and as far as I can tell we can't just
  ; filter "all resource files" by whether or not they end in ".alda", so I
  ; guess we'll just have to manually list them all out here.
  ;
  ; On the plus side, this does allow us to easily test only certain scores by
  ; commenting out the ones we don't want to test.
