# This script ensures that the current content of the player/ directory has a
# build and adds the build directory (containing the `alda-player` executable)
# to the PATH.
#
# When no arguments are provided, the script starts a subshell with the amended
# PATH.
#
# When arguments are provided, they are interpreted as a command to be run
# within this environment with the amended PATH.
#
# Example usage 1:
#
#   bin/player-on-path client/bin/run examples/track-volume.alda
#
# Example usage 2:
#
#   cd client
#   ../bin/player-on-path     # starts a subshell w/ player on PATH
#   $ bin/run examples/hello_world.alda
#   $ bin/run examples/phase.alda
