# Contributing to Alda

We're working on the following projects:

- The Alda [**client**](#client), written in Go.
- The Alda [**player**](#player), written in Kotlin.
- The official Alda website, [**alda.io**](https://alda.io).

The source code for the Alda client and player lives in this repo.

The website has [its own repo][alda-site-repo].

Pull requests to contribute to any of these projects are warmly welcomed. Please
feel free to take on any open issue that interests you, and let us know if you
need any help!

## Development Guide

### Client

The Alda client is a Go program that parses input (Alda code), turns it into a
data representation of a musical score, and sends instructions to an Alda player
process to perform the score.

For more info, see the [README](client/README.md) in the `client/` folder of
this repo.

### Player

Alda is designed so that playback is asynchronous. When you use the Alda client
to play a score, the client sends a bunch of [OSC][osc-page] messages to a
separate player process running in the background.

The player process is agnostic of the Alda language. It simply receives and
handles OSC messages containing lower-level instructions that tell it what
notes to play, etc.

The player supports live coding in that it allows you to define, modify, and
loop patterns during playback.

For more info, see the [README](player/README.md) in the `player/` folder of
this repo.
