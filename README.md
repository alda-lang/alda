Alda is a text-based programming language for music composition. It allows you
to compose and play back music using only your text editor and the command line.

```alda
piano:
  o3
  g8 a b > c d e f+ g | a b > c d e f+ g4
  g8 f+ e d c < b a g | f+ e d c < b a g4
  << g1/>g/>g/b/>d/g
```

> For more examples, see these [example scores](./examples/).

The language's design equally favors aesthetics, flexibility and ease of use.

(Why compose music this way instead of in a graphical sheet music notation
program? See [this blog post][alda-blog-post] for a brief history and
rationale.)

## Features

* Easy to understand, markup-like syntax.
* Designed for musicians who don't know how to program, as well as programmers
  who don't know how to music.
* A score is a text file that can be played using the `alda` command-line tool.
* [Interactive REPL](doc/alda-repl.md) lets you enter Alda code and hear the
  results in real time.
* Supports [writing music
  programmatically](doc/writing-music-programmatically.md) (for algorithmic
  composition, live coding, etc.)
* Create MIDI music using any of the instruments in the [General MIDI Sound
  Set][gm-sound-set]

### Planned

> If you'd like to help, come on in -- [the water's fine](#contributing)!

* [Define and use waveform synthesis instruments](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/100)
* [Import MIDI files](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/issues/25)
* [Export to MusicXML](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/issues/3) for inter-operability with other music software
* [A more robust REPL](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-client-java/issues/2), tailor-made for editing scores interactively
