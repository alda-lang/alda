# The Alda player

Alda is designed so that playback is asynchronous. When you use the Alda
[client](../client) to play a score, the client sends a bunch of
[OSC][osc-page] messages to a player process running in the background.

[osc-page]: http://opensoundcontrol.org

The player process is agnostic of the Alda language. It simply receives and
handles OSC messages containing lower-level instructions pertaining to audio
playback.

The player supports live coding in that it allows you to define, modify, and
loop patterns during playback.

## Development

> Once you're all set up to run the Alda player process locally, have a look at
> the [development guide](./doc/development-guide.md) for a high-level overview
> of the code base.

### Requirements

* Java 8+
  * You probably already have Java 8 or higher installed.

    To check what version of Java you have, you can run `java -version`.

* Gradle (optional)
  * There is a `gradlew` wrapper script checked into the repo that makes it so
    that you don't need to have Gradle installed.

    In the commands below, you can replace `gradle` with `./gradlew` and it
    should work the same as if you had Gradle installed.

### Running a player process

After following the instructions below to start a player process on a particular
port, you can then use the [Alda client](../client) to send messages on the same
port.

There are two ways to run the player process locally:

* **Basic**: run a script and pass it arguments as if you're running
  `alda-player` on your PATH. Takes a little bit longer sometimes, but is more
  convenient most of the time and it's exactly like running a release
  executable.

* **Gradle**: use `gradle` (or `./gradlew`) for faster builds (no need to fully
  compile the executable) and more control over build options. Useful if you're
  handy with Gradle and you know what you're doing.

#### Basic

To run the player with no arguments, which displays usage information:

```bash
# equivalent to running `alda-player`
bin/run
```

To run the player, listening on port 27278 (or replace with the port number of
your choosing):

```bash
# equivalent to running `alda-player run -p 27278`
bin/run run -p 27278
```

#### Gradle

To run the player with no arguments, which displays usage information:

```bash
# equivalent to running `alda-player`
gradle run
```

To run the player, listening on port 27278 (or replace with the port number of
your choosing):

```bash
# equivalent to running `alda-player run -p 27278`
gradle run --args "run -p 27278"
```

### Compiling and testing alda-player.js

alda-player.js is the in-browser version of the Alda player process. It depends
on alda.wasm, which is compiled from the [Go client](../client) code.

To compile the source in `src/jsMain` to alda-player.js, run:

```bash
bin/build-js
```

This creates the optimized/minified JavaScript source file
`build/distributions/alda-player.js`, as well as the source map file
`build/distributions/alda-player.js.map`.

> `jsBrowserRun`, `jsBrowserWebpack`, and `jsBrowserProductionWebpack`, but I
> consider it too buggy to be usable in the intended way. I've observed major
> issues like the build succeeding but the output JS not getting updated. This
> is why I wrote `bin/build-js`, which is slower than the out-of-the-box tooling,
> but more reliable. It deletes the output files and then re-runs the
> `jsBrowserProductionWebpack` task from scratch.

> It's a shame, because it would be nice to do things the official way and get
> incremental compilation and whatnot, but c'est la vie.

Then, you can run the `test-page/serve` script, which serves a simple HTML test
page on localhost. The page includes both alda.wasm and alda-player.js, so that
both the `Alda` (provided by alda.wasm) and `AldaPlayer` (provided by
alda-player.js) objects are available to use in the JS console.
